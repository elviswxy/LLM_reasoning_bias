## üß† Mitigating Social Bias from Reasoning-based LLMs with ADBP

ADBP incrementally introduces reasoning steps to isolate their influence on the final answer. It selects the answer if all answers are consistent across reasoning steps and resolves ambiguity through a targeted comparison of conflicting answers and their associated reasoning.

This script processes a JSON file of questions using a specified reasoning-based LLM and outputs the model's responses into a CSV file.

### üìå Usage

```bash
python adbp.py <jsonfilename> <outputfilename> <modelid> <gpu>
```

### üìù Arguments

| Argument         | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jsonfilename`   | `str`  | Path to the input JSON file containing questions.                           |
| `outputfilename` | `str`  | Path to the output CSV file to store the new answers under ADBP.            |
| `modelid`        | `str`  | Model ID or path to the reasoning-based LLM (e.g., `deepseek-ai/...`).      |
| `gpu`            | `int`  | GPU device ID to run the model on (e.g., `0`, `1`, ...).                    |

### ‚úÖ Example

```bash
python adbp.py data/questions.json output/answers.csv deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B 0
```
